# BirthdayQueue
## A script that lets people queue music to spotify by sending an email. 
This was created for a birthday party. The script reads emails from an email inbox, detects spotify uris and adds them to a playlist. The script keeps track of the playtime and removes each song after it has been played (altough, pausing the playing will destroy the queue :)

It also updates a website to show anyone interested which songs are in queued.

Due to my then lack of time and server knowledge the script was run at my local computer, and the website was hosted at Google Drive (this function has since been deprecated by Google).
